# shim

The Shim API provides an ultra-thin layer of Farcaster API calls, designed to scale to zero and run at minimal cost.

It runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh/) [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) deployed to [Render](https://render.com), with Upstash and Neon Postgres as minimal persistent storage.

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [<http://localhost:3000>](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy to Render

See the [ElysiaJS quickstart guide](https://docs.render.com/deploy-elysiajs) for full details.
